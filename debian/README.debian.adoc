= Building fazantix

== Release-specific stuff

=== bullseye

We need to bring our own NodeJS and Golang environments.

Node we can get from Nodesource and add it as an extra repository;
golang we will need to download/build ourselves.

Perhaps we can make dynamic Build-Depends for this, but it won't be completely reproducible.

=== bookworm

We need to use golang from `bookworm-backports` (it includes 1.23).
`apt` does *not* want to use it, as the Release file contains `NotAutomatic: yes`;
this is overridable by using `aptitude` for resolving dependencies.

[source,console]
----
$ sbuild -c bookworm --extra-repository="deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main" --build-dep-resolver=aptitude
----

Also note that npm is not happy with the version of vite in `package.json`, although it builds successfully:

[source,console]
----
npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {
npm WARN EBADENGINE   package: 'vite@7.0.6',
npm WARN EBADENGINE   required: { node: '^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0' },
npm WARN EBADENGINE   current: { node: 'v18.20.4', npm: '9.2.0' }
npm WARN EBADENGINE }

=== trixie

This actually builds cleanly :)

[source,console]
----
$ sbuild -c trixie
